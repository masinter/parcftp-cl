This directory contains working files for the X3J13 Ansi Common Lisp
committee.  Of interest here are:

dpANS1:	        The working draft that became the first draft proposed
		American National Standard.  This document is no longer
		current, and is kept around for historical purposes only.

dpANS2:         The second draft proposed American National Standard.
		See the file Reviewer-Notes.text for further information.

dpANS3:         An X3J13 internal document.  A letter ballot is presently
                being taken to see if this will become the third draft
                proposed American National Standard.  Until the
                results of the letter ballot are tallied, this
                document has no offical standard as a dpANS.  This
                document contains only editorial changes since dpANS2.
                See the files Reviewer-Notes.text,
                Change-Summary.text, and Change-Log.text for details.

		X3J13 meetings. (For historical purposes only.  Most
