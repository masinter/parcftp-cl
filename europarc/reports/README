EuroPARC Technical Reports

The full set of EuroPARC technical reports are now available on-line
in Postscript through the World-Wide Web. They can be reached through
our home page at URL http://www.xerox.com/RXRC/Cambridge/home.html.

A separate repository for anonymous ftp access is being arranged.

Paper copies can be ordered by post; see Order-form.ps for a listing
of reports available, and other details.

Please note: due to copyright issues, our technical reports are
temporarily unavailable. They'll be made available again in batches,
as we come to arrangements with various copyright holders (publishers
of journals, conference proceedings and so on). The first batch of
reports should be available in February.
