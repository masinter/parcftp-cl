 Changed product files:

   chap-0.dvi.Z             78327(8) 08/13/94 00:06:00 ftp

   Actually, if one re-ran TeX, all of the chapters chap-1.dvi
   through chap-26.dvi (and chap-a.dvi) would also change because
   the header on each page would change.  But no other part would
   change and it's not recommended that you kill the trees needed
   to print those other files if you don't have to.

   Eventually, those .dvi.Z files may be placed here just in case,
   but for now we haven't bothered.

 Other support files:

   signatures.text            245(8) 08/13/94 00:07:00 ftp
