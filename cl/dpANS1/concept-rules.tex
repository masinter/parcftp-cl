%% Overview of General Rules

This purpose of this chapter is to provide information that cannot be
localized to a single chapter or dictionary entry without introducing
substantial redundancy among a large number of entries.

Rules that generally apply only to \term{defined names} in a particular
chapter are located at the beginning of that chapter.  For example, 
rules about floating point \term{contagion} would be at the beginning of 
\chapref\Numbers.

For each rule in this chapter, the \term{defined names} to which the
rule applies will be specified, and each of those \term{defined names}
will refer back to the rule by reference.
