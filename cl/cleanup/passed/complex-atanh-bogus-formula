Problem description:

The formula that defines ATANH in CLtL is incorrect, apparently
because of a mistranscription of a formula from Penfield's article.

CLtL has:   arctanh z = log ((1+z) sqrt(1 - (1 / z^2)))

Should be:  arctanh z = log ((1+z) sqrt(1 / (1 - z^2)))

However, given the change to ATAN in issue COMPLEX-ATAN-BRANCH-CUT,
it seems simpler to follow Kahan's recommendation and define

	arctanh z = (log(1+z) - log(1-z))/2

thereby preserving the identity  i arctan z = arctanh iz .

Kahan also notes that Penfield's formula for arccosh (CLtL p. 213)

	arccosh z = log(z + (z + 1) sqrt((z-1)/(z+1)))

has a gratuitous removable singularity at z=-1 and recommends

	arccosh z = 2 log(sqrt((z+1)/2) + sqrt((z-1)/2))

which has the same values and is also well-defined at z=-1.

Finally, Kahan recommends a different defining formula for acos
that is more similar to that of acosh (but less similar to that
of asin).


Proposal (COMPLEX-ATANH-BRANCH-CUT:TWEAK-MORE):
  
(1) Replace the erroneous formula

	arctanh z = log ((1+z) sqrt(1 - (1 / z^2)))
with
	arctanh z = (log(1+z) - log(1-z))/2

(2) Note that  i arctan z = arctanh iz .

(3) Replace the gratuitously singular formula

	arccosh z = log(z + (z + 1) sqrt((z-1)/(z+1)))
with
	arccosh z = 2 log(sqrt((z+1)/2) + sqrt((z-1)/2))

(4) Adopt the formula (already in CLtL)

	arccos z = (pi / 2) - arcsin z

as the official definition of arccos, and also note that the
formulas

	arccos z = -i log(z + i sqrt(1 - z^2))

(already in CLtL) and

	arccos z = 2 log(sqrt((1+z)/2) + i sqrt((1-z)/2)) / i

(recommended by Kahan) are equivalent.



Rationale:

Compatibility with what seems to be becoming standard practice.

  
Current practice:

Implementations I have checked have a correct implementation
of ATANH rather than slavishly following the bogus CLtL formula.


Cost to Implementors:

ATANH must be rewritten.  It is not a very difficult fix.

Possibly ACOSH must be rewritten.  It is not a very difficult fix.


Cost to Users:

The compatibility note on p. 210 of CLtL gave users fair warning that
a change of this kind might be adopted.


Cost of non-adoption:

Possible incorrect implementations of ATANH.

Incompatibility with HP calculators.


Benefits:

Numerical analysts may find the new definition easier to use.


Esthetics:

A toss-up, except to those who care.


Discussion:

Kahan's article not only discussed formulas but also gives specific
implementation techniques for use with IEEE 754 arithmetic.
