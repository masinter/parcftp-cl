Problem Description:

The action of IMPORT on the home package of a symbol is not described well; does it affects the "home package" of a symbol.

Proposal (IMPORT-SETF-SYMBOL-PACKAGE:YES):

IMPORT behaves as follows: if any symbol to be imported has no home package (SYMBOL-PACKAGE returns NIL), then IMPORT sets the home package of the symbol to the specified package being imported to.

Rationale:

Current practice:

Most Common Lisp implementations work this way. 

Adoption Cost:

small -- it requires a simple rewrite if not done this way.

Benefits:

Without this proposal, there is confusion about how Common Lisp works, and the risks that some new implementations will not work this way.

Conversion Cost:

None, as this describes current practice.   

Discussion: 

The cleanup committee supports this clarification.
