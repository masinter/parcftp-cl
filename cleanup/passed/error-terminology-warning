Problem description:

  Page 1-12 of the draft defines the phrase "a warning should be issued"
  in a way that is not consistent with "an error should be signalled."
  The latter "should" refers to the safety level, but the former
  "should" just means "might" (depending on the implementation).

  To use this term is to muddy the otherwise clear conceptual relation
  between "should" and "high safety".

  This is Symbolics issue #1.

Proposal (ERROR-TERMINOLOGY-WARNING:MIGHT):

  Change the term to "a warning might be issued" and update all uses of
  the term throughout the document.

Rationale:
  
  It's important for the document to be consistent in its terminology.
  
Current practice:

  People are sloppy in their terminology.

Performance impact:

  None.

Benefits:

  The specification document will be less difficult to understand.
