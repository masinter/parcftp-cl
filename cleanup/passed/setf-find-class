Problem description:

  Is (SETF (FIND-CLASS 'FOO) NIL) permitted as a way to break the link from
  a name to a class?  I can't find anything in the CLOS spec for or against
  this.

  This is Symbolics issue #27.

Proposal (SETF-FIND-CLASS:ALLOW-NIL):

  Define (SETF (FIND-CLASS 'FOO) NIL) to cause FOO no longer to name a class.
  If FOO already does not name a class, the operation has no effect.

  This does not affect the class formerly named by FOO, if any, except that
  if FOO was that class's proper name, the class no longer has a proper name.

Rationale:

  This is simpler than putting in a new function to break the association
  between a name and a class.  When CMAKUNBOUND was removed from an early
  draft of 88-002R, it was probably intended to add this SETF of FIND-CLASS
  feature to replace it, but the document was accidentally not updated.

Current practice:

  Symbolics Genera 8.0, TI Explorer release 6.0, and Lucid 4.0.0 Beta-1
  implement the proposal.  Other CLOS implementations were not surveyed.

Cost to Implementors:

  Easy.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  There will be no portable way to break the association between a name and
  a class.

Performance impact:

  None.

Benefits:

  Adds a useful feature that was probably intended to be there all along.

Esthetics:

  More complete language.

Discussion:

  Gregor Kiczales says he supports SETF-FIND-CLASS:ALLOW-NIL.
