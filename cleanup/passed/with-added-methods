Problem description:

  WITH-ADDED-METHODS has a strange definition that is hard to understand
  and apparently is not what was intended by the person who originally
  proposed the feature.  No CLOS implementation is known that supports it.

  This is Symbolics issue #17.

Proposal (WITH-ADDED-METHODS:DELETE):

  Remove WITH-ADDED-METHODS from the language and remove that symbol from
  the COMMON-LISP package.

Rationale:

  Why add something new that no one uses or wants?

Current practice:

  No CLOS implementation is known to support WITH-ADDED-METHODS.

Cost to Implementors:

  Trivial.

Cost to Users:

  None.

Cost of non-adoption:

  We would either have to get the implementors to implement it or explain
  why we put this thing in the language that everyone refuses to implement.

Performance impact:

  None.

Benefits:

  Smaller language.

Esthetics:

  Smaller language.

Discussion:

  Gregor Kiczales says he supports WITH-ADDED-METHODS:DELETE.
